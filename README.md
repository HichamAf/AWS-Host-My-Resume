# Host a static resume with AWS

In this project, I've divided the tasks into three main parts:

## Part 1:
- Develop HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for my resume.
- Upload the files to an S3 bucket.
- Configure S3 to host a static website accessible to the public.

## Part 2:
- Acquire a domain name using Route 53.
- Update DNS records to direct to the S3 website endpoint.

## Part 3:
- Implement SSL/HTTPS using AWS Certificate Manager.
- Establish a CloudFront distribution for the project.

AWS Services: S3 · CloudFront · Route 53
